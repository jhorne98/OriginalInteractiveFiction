# OriginalInteractiveFiction
Interactive Fiction Written in Inform 6.

Interactive fiction (IF, text adventure) games are some of the earliest computer games. They are, of course, a dying form, but have found a resurgence in a wave of 80s nostalgia that has swept popular culture. Inform provides a simple way to build and test original IF games. It is a direct descendant of the original engine used to creat ZORK. These are small games I've made.

Inform 6 is deprecated. If you'd like to learn to make interactive fiction with the newest version of Inform, use Inform 7: http://inform7.com/

I don't like I7 very much. I find it clunky and too verbose to be a good programming language.
