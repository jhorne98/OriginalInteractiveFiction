THE TUNNEL AND THE OUTWARD MIND "How far in were you when the pictures on the walls began to move?"

You've arrived at the Sideling Hill tunnel in Fulton County, Pennsylvania. They built the turnpike right over this thing in the 70's, and it has been 
defunct since. It's about a mile-and-a-half long, and you've seen bikers go through every time you've come. This time is gonna be odd. You brought a 
tab of acid with you. You're wondering about how that will effect all the graffiti on the walls, what kind of weird heightened monster art it's gonna 
turn into.

The road is narrow. You wonder if cars of the past were smaller.

The main tunnel proper will have four or five locations moving in an east-west direction. The service stations will have several rooms, and there will 
be locations outside of the tunnel, including the parking lot, the trail to the tunnel, the spots above the service stations, and the blower rooms. 
The serviceway above the tunnel will be traverseable, and there will be a door at the midway point of the serviceway. This door will lead to a proper 
dungeon, culminating at an exitway near the turnpike.

Dropping the acid will have a special effect on the environment for 100 turns, then will diminish for 25 turns until there is none left. The acid will 
be required for the defeating of the dungeon, but can be dropped at any time. There will be a merchant in the tunnel who only sells one more tab of 
acid.

There will be an imp that moves about the map. He'll be tricky at best and malicious at worst. Damned tunnel midget.
